      Hello again! I decided to go the route of using notifications like this for smaller updates so it's not so{' '}
      <em>in your face</em>. However, I still wanted to make sure you'd be aware of newer features as they appear!
    </p>
    <h2>New Feature(s)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Album Accents</strong> - Changes your accent color based on the currently playing song! This color comes
        from the more vibrant colors in the album art, similar to Android Oreo. Props to /u/DankCool for the suggestion!{' '}

      <li>
        <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> - Fixed some colors in the player; Fixed version number bug in Play Midnight
        Options; Some smaller optimizations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That's all for now! Sorry for the interruption!{' '}
